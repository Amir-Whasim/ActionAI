ActionAI is a python library for training machine learning models to classify human action. It is a generalization of our [yoga smart personal trainer](https://www.hackster.io/yogai/yogai-smart-personal-trainer-f53744), which is included in this repo as an example.

## Getting Started 
These instructions will show how to prepare your image data, train a model, and deploy the model to classify human action from image samples. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live stream.

### Prerequisites
- [tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [opencv](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

### Installing
We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid any conflicts with your systems global configuration. You can install the required dependencies via pip:

```bash
# Assuming your python path points to python 3.x 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All preprocessing, training, and deployment configuration variables are stored in the ```conf.py``` file in the ```config/``` directory. You can create your own conf.py files and store them in this directory for fast experimentation.

The ```conf.py``` file included imports a LinearRegression model as our classifier by default.

### Example
After proprocessing your image data using the ```preprocess.py``` script, you can create a model by calling the ```actionModel()```function, which creates a scikit-learn pipeline. Then, call the ```trainModel()``` function with your data to train:

```python
# Stage your model
pipeline = actionModel(config.classifier())

# Train your model
model = trainModel(config.csv_path, pipeline)
```

## Data processing 
Arrange your image data as a directory of subdirectories, each subdirectory named as a label for the images contained in it. Your directory structure should look like this:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ images_dir
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ class_1
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sample1.png
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sample2.jpg
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ class_2
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sample1.png
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sample2.jpg
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
.   .
.   .
```
Samples should be standard image files recognized by the pillow library.

To generate a dataset from your images, run the ```preprocess.py``` script.
```bash
python preprocess.py
```
This will stage the labeled image dataset in a csv file written to the ```data/``` directory.

## Training
After reading the csv file into a dataframe, a custom scikit-learn transformer estimates body keypoints to produce a low-dimensional feature vector for each sample image. This representation is fed into a scikit-learn classifier set in the config file. 

Run the train.py script to train and save a classifier
```bash
python train.py
```

The pickled model will be saved in the ```models/``` directory

## Deployment
We've provided a sample inference script, ```inference.py```, that will read input from a webcam, mp4, or rstp stream, run inference on each frame, and print inference results.
